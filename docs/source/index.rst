Stormpath Servlet Plugin
=========================

The Stormpath Servlet Plugin is a drop-in plugin for `Servlet`_-based web applications that makes it *incredibly* simple to add user management and authentication to your application.

It aims to completely abstract away all user registration, login, authentication and authorization workloads as well as properly secure the web app.  It is completely flexible - use only the functionality you need or leverage the entire feature set.

And the best part? **You don't even need a database!**
